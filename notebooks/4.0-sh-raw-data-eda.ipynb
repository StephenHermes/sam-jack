    "Now that we have our raw data, the next main goal is getting the data in a form that can be ingested by a model. For this we will need three things:\n",
    "1. **Good, clean data.** This is the biggest hurdle. Once we've processed the raw data into a form we can actually make use of, we will want to explore its quality. Some things to look out for are: typical length of a summary, how many null summaries or cast lists we have, what proportion have Samuel L. Jackson in the cast, prevalence and occurrence of missing data, etc.\n",
    "2. **Labels.** In our case, we are looking to classify films as either \"staring\" Samuel L. Jackson or not. The working definition of \"staring\" will be that he is included in the cast. This is clearly a coarse definition: the character John Arnold (of \"hold on to your butts\" fame) portrayed by SLJ is hardly the main character of Jurassic Park.\n",
    "3. **Features.** For now we will just do minor cleanup of the summaries from OMDb, if anything. The hardcore numeric feature engineering we will save for the machine learning step, so that we can experiment with different numerical enocoding techniques (bag-of-words vs word2vec vs...).\n",
