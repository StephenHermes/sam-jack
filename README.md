==============================

This is a sample data science project done from start to (some degree of) finish, using the `cookiecutter` project structure. The goal is to perform <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://ropensci.github.io/reproducibility-guide/sections/introduction/">reproducible</a> work.

**The Project.** Here we use natural language processing to predict a film's genre based off of a plain text plot summary. Included are notebooks and scripts illustrating different techniques of data science, including:
- web scraping to get film plots and genre data,
- data visualization to explore the data,
- natural language processing to engineer features from plain text, and
- machine learning training, tuning and evaluation.

**Why Sam Jack?** This project started off with a different goal involving Samuel L. Jackson.
